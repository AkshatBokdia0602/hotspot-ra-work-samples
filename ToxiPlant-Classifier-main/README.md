# ToxiPlant-Classifier 🌳

The ToxiPlant Classifier is a machine learning project designed to classify plants as either toxic or non-toxic using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This project leverages a dataset of plant images and corresponding toxicity labels to train a robust classifier capable of distinguishing between toxic and non-toxic plants.
